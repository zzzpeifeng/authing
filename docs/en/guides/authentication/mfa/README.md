# About Multi-Factor Authentication

<LastUpdated/>

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a simple security authentication technique that can add an extra layer of protection in addition to the user name and password. After enabling MFA, when users perform operations, in addition to providing the user name and password (first authentication), they also need to perform a second authentication. MFA will provide more information for your account and resources with higher security protection. For more information about Multi-Factor Authentication, see [What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?](/concepts/mfa.md).
