The Pipeline function is a custom JavaScript code executed in the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} authentication process. With the help of Pipeline, developers can easily customize and extend the capabilities of {{$localeConfig.brandName}}.

## Select a pipeline template

{{$localeConfig.brandName}} provides many templates that can be used directly to help you get started quickly.

You can also view the list of Pipeline template functions here：[https://github.com/authing/pipeline](https://github.com/authing/pipeline). At the same time, you are welcome to contribute to us the Pipeline template function.

First, select the Console's**Extention Capabilities** - **Custom Pipeline** page and you will see some tips.
