# Account lifecycle management

<LastUpdated/>

With the development of the company, the number of internal applications and personnel will continue to increase. Constant enrollment and resignation of employees, frequent adjustments to the organizational structure of personnel and complex application account systems within the enterprise will cause a sharp increase in the workload of administrators who manually operate accounts. At the same time, the lack of a unified account management control scheme will also bring hidden dangers to safe production. For example, there are often security risk cases in which employees leave but the application accounts are still not deleted.

Replacing manual account management with automatic account **Lifecycle Management (LCM)** is the key to liberating enterprise IT personnel from the tedious and complex identity information management work involved in flexible employment. At the same time, it can also improve the overall business safety factor of the enterprise by closing personnel accounts in time and reducing the authorization error rate.

## Increase Productivity and Reduce Costs

- Automatic access from creation to deletion: there is no need to press a button and wait. Use the resources needed to get your employees to start and work quickly, and make time for the IT team to work on larger projects. 
- Fast and safe pre-configuration: automatic access management not only saves you time, but also saves you money. Faster pre-configuration means you will reclaim software licenses and save costs. And, let us start with the money saved by not being hacked through a still-active account.

## Reduce Complexity

Use automatic processes to solve complexity: The enterprise deployed a hub-and-spoke model, which includes a centralized unified identity supply platform. The internal applications of the enterprise are the endpoints of the hub-and-spoke model, and each application endpoint is connected to the unified identity supply platform. For each identity created in the unified identity supply platform, a suffix is applied to each identity to ensure that the identities will not conflict with themselves.This feature eliminates manual processes related to changes in the company's internal personnel. For example, if the first and last name of a new employee is the same as the first and last name of the current employee, the workflow will identify and resolve the situation so that each user has a unique email address and username.

## Increase Safety and Standard

From the employeeâ€™s employment, all account assignments and withdrawals are guaranteed by an automatic process to prevent employees from being manually assigned to an over-authorized account, or the account is not retracted after employees leave the company, resulting in a security risk of enterprise information leakage. In addition, each link in the lifecycle operation process such as account allocation and withdrawal has corresponding log records to ensure the safety and compliance of the company's production process.
