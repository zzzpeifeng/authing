access_token will be transmitted in the form of URL **hash**. The example of links after redirection is:

```
https://authing.cn/#access_token=56d7c5649b486abfa67798d11c7e98ea741cab58&state=1234124
```

You can extract the token parameters from the URL:

```js
let r = new URLSearchParams(location.hash.slice(1))
let accessToken = r.get('token')
```

::: hint-success
Why is the information in the URL hash instead of the query? Because the hash content will not be sent directly to the server, which avoid access_token from being stolen.
